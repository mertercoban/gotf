## Summary
We made a tile based, 2D dungeon crawler game with top-down oblique perspective. There is a cave among the trees in the forest.
When our character enters the cave, little monsters appear in front of him and begin to attack our character. 
The cave consists of three floors and when we kill all the creatures on the floor, we can move on to the next floor. 
On the last floor (fourth floor), there is the end game boss which spawns those creatures. 
When the boss is killed, the game is over, and the trees are safe.
